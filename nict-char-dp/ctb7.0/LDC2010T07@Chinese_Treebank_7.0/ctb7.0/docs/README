11. Description of the corpus structure and data attributes:
    There are 2,448 text files in this release, containing 51,447 sentences,
    1,196,329  words, 1,931,381 hanzi (Chinese characters). The data is provided
    in the UTF-8 encoding, and the annotation has Penn Treebank-style
    labeled brackets. Details of the annotation standard can be found in the
    enclosed segmentation, POS-tagging and bracketing guidelines. The data is
    provided in four different formats: raw text, word segmented, word
    segmented and  POS-tagged, and syntactically bracketed formats.

12. Quality control: 
    The data is partially double-annotated and adjudicated. The list of
    double-annotated and adjudicated files are listed in
    'gold-standard-files.txt' and they are the recommended test files for tool
    evaluation (e.g., automatic word segmentation, POS-tagging and parsing).All
    files have been automatically verified and manually checked.
